# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the factors influencing passenger survival. The analysis includes data inspection, cleaning, visualization, and identifying meaningful patterns in the dataset. EDA helps uncover relationships between variables such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival rate.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure and distribution of the Titanic dataset
- Identify and handle missing values
- Analyze survival patterns across different features
- Visualize relationships between variables
- Extract meaningful insights from the dataset
